# Fine-Tuning LLaMA-2 7B with LoRA

## 📌 About the Project

This project shows how to fine-tune **LLaMA-2 7B Chat** on your own dataset using **LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation). By combining LoRA with **4-bit quantization**, the training runs smoothly even on a single **Google Colab T4 GPU**.

The goal is to make large language models easier to adapt for **specific tasks or domains** without needing huge hardware.

## 🔑 How It Works

1. **Set up the environment** with libraries like `transformers`, `peft`, `datasets`, and `bitsandbytes`.
2. **Load the base model** (LLaMA-2 7B Chat) and apply 4-bit quantization to save memory.
3. **Prepare the dataset** (text, CSV, PDF, etc.) and convert it into a training-ready format.
4. **Fine-tune with LoRA**, updating only a small number of model parameters.
5. **Train & test** the model with your data.
6. **Run inference** and use the model locally or with Ollama.
